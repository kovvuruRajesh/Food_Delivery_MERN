    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kovvuruRajesh/Food_Delivery_MERN.git
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install the frontend project dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the frontend.

### 🖥️ Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install the backend project dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the backend server:

## Project Setup

This project is a full-stack food delivery application built with the MERN stack. Below are the steps to set up both the frontend and backend components of the application.

---

### Frontend

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kovvuruRajesh/Food_Delivery_MERN.git
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install the frontend project dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the frontend.

---

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install the backend project dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    npm run server
    ```

4. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the backend server in action.

---

Both the frontend and backend must be running concurrently for the full application to work correctly. The frontend runs on port `3000`, and the backend runs on port `8080`.
